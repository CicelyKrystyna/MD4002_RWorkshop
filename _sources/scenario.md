# Scenario

We are a part of a research team conducting a study that aims to understand if there is an association between the average number of hours an individual sleeps each night and the development of hypertension in adults aged 40 years or older. The research team believes that the following factors could obscure such an association, and as such should be adjusted for:

* Average daily alcohol consumption `[alcohol_day]`
* Regular use of marijuana `[regular_marij]`
* Is participant currently a smoker `[smoke_now]`
* Is participant regularly physically active `[phys_active]`
* BMI Group (underweight, healthy, overweight, obese) `[bmi]`

To answer this research question, we will use the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) provided within the data file sleep.csv.

The statistical methods for survey data are beyond the scope of this R workshop, as such we will treat this data as if it was collected from randomly selected individuals.
