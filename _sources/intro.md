# R Workshop - Data Analysis

In this workshop we will walk through the data analysis portion of a hypothetical research project. The data analysis will be conducted in R. We encourage you to use R Studio - a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Please follow the instructions under **Getting Started** to download both R and RStudio.

However, to ensure that you can follow along, this workshop has been written as a Notebook with fully executable code.
