# R Workshop - Data Analysis

In this workshop we will walk through the data analysis portion of a hypothetical research project. The workshop is written as a notebook: [Data Workflow](https://cicelykrystyna.github.io/MD4002_RWorkshop/MD4002_RWorkshop.html). 

The data analysis will be conducted in R. We encourage you to use R Studio - a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Please follow the instructions under **Installing R & RStudio** to download both [R](https://cicelykrystyna.github.io/MD4002_RWorkshop/installR.html) and [RStudio](https://cicelykrystyna.github.io/MD4002_RWorkshop/installRStudio.html).

To familiarise yourself with R ahead of the workshop please follow the notebook: [Introduction to R](https://cicelykrystyna.github.io/MD4002_RWorkshop/RBasics.html) under **Getting Started**.

```{note}
If for some reason you are not using RStudio each notebook has been written with fully executable code. To access an inerative version of each notebook navigate to the notebook, click on the rocket launcher in the top right and select Colab (Google Colab).
